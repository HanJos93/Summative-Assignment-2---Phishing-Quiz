# Buckinghamshire Council - Phishing 101

## Introduction and Proposed MVP

The Buckinghamshire Council is a large organisation with approximately 5000 employee’s and acts as the local authority for Buckinghamshire County. The organisation provides a vast array of service from adult’s and children’s social care to waste collection and even business licenses, permits and rates. With such a large variety of skills, knowledge and experience it is vital that everyone is on the same page when it comes to IT security, therefore I proposed a quiz that would ensure that those who take it understand the fundamentals of phishing attacks. As more systems become digitised cyber-attacks become increasingly common, understanding how the most frequent type of attack, phishing, works will serve to reduce the potential risks to the organisation. 

The quiz will ask a series of multiple-choice questions which tests awareness about the nature of phishing attacks, the user will need to achieve a score of at least 80% to pass. The scores will be permanently stored within a .csv file along with the user’s name, the date they took the quiz and whether they achieved a passing score. The information stored within the .csv file can then be used to identify which users could benefit from further cyber security training. Overall, I believe this quiz will further strengthen the councils already robust cyber security measures as the weakest link in almost all potential cyber attacks is the human element, reducing the risks here will decrease the overall risk of a successful attack.  

## Design

To begin designing this quiz, I first considered what this quiz should look like and how users will interact with it. With this in mind, I decided on using the cloud-based design tool Figma to visualise the graphical user interface and simulate the customer journey. Below is the completed diagram.

Before building this visualisation I gathered examples of current Buckinghamshire Council employee training course and elected to use a similar layout and the exact colors used to represent the organisation. This ensures that it follows the brand guidelines as well as being recognisible to internal staff as a Buckinghamshire Council product. Designing the first frame of the quiz was the most important as it would set a design precident that all following frames, buttons and labels would need to follow to maintain the integrity of the not only the quiz design but also the brand image
